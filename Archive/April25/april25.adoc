= Quarantine Trivia Week 3

== Your Hosts: Haylie and Mitch

== Possible Total Points: 125

=== Before we begin, we request that each captain email Haylie with 2 things:
1. Your Team Name
2. Your Vegas Round Choice

*The Vegas Round* : Each team may pick one category from the list below before starting the game (except for rounds with an * those already have bonus points built in). For whichever category you pick you get to choose 5 questions in that round to "bet" on. If you get those questions right, you get 2 points, but if you get them wrong, you get -1. May the odds be in your favor. When that round comes along make sure your captain marks which questions you are choosing to use as your VR!
